I'm a frontend developer passionate about building responsive, accessible, and efficient interfaces — but I’m also expanding my skills in backend development to become more versatile and confident as a full-stack developer.

## About Me  
I'm currently studying **Industrial Management** at the **Technical University of Košice**. In my development journey, I’ve specialized in building modern interfaces using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **SASS** — tools I use to create clean, responsive, and maintainable frontend applications.

As my skills evolved, I grew interested in the full development cycle and started diving deeper into backend technologies like **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Docker**, expanding my capabilities beyond the client side. 

When I’m not coding, I:  
- Spend time at the **gym** 💪  
- Enjoy **nature** and take long walks outdoors 🌿  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
